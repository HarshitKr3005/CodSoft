# CodeSoft Internship Tasks

This repository contains the tasks and projects completed during my internship at CodSoft. Below is an overview of the tasks completed, along with descriptions and links to relevant files and documentation.

## Task 1 : TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

- Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data.

- The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

## Task 2 : SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON

- Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection.
 
- In businesses that offer products or services, the role of a Data Scientist is crucial for predicting future sales. They utilize machine learning techniques in Python to analyze and interpret data, allowing them to make informed decisions regarding advertising costs. By leveraging these predictions, businesses can optimize their advertising strategies and maximize sales potential. Let'

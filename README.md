# CodeSoft Internship Tasks

This repository contains the tasks and projects completed during my internship at CodSoft. Below is an overview of the tasks completed, along with descriptions and links to relevant files and documentation.

Task 1 : TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data.

The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.
